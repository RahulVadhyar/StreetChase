Things to be done
    -Things I can do right now
        -ANIMATION(BIG ONE HUGE PRIORITY)
            -update function to be written

        -multiple weapons
            -can be changed using the keys 1-9
            -Need to display on the HUD, need a system for that
            -Need to display weapons on the ground and need a pick up system for it
        

        -particle effects
            -optimize it to maximize performance
        
    -Later
        -level design
        -Enemy AI
            -Enemy will go towards player
            -if player has a gun and is staring in his direction, then look out for bullets
            -if player has fired bullets in last 1 sec then go out of the way of bullets
            -Try to go in range of player slowly if near and fast if not near
            -If within range, fire Bullet
            -Add a little bit of randomness to all of this for not predictable behaviour
        -death screen
        -sound effects
        -main menu design
        

    -Paused for now as other things are needed before we can further work on this
        -Level editor class and cpp file
        -Level File system
          
Optimizations I want to do
    
    - Optimize the shaders
    - Multi instanced rendering
    - Need a better collision system

If time permits
    -Add ability in level editor to import your own textures
---more as progress moves on
