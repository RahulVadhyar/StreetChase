    -Paused for now as other things are needed before we can further work on this
        This is most likely cancelled at this point as there is little point and will be too complicated
        -Level editor class and cpp file
        -Level File system
          
Optimizations I want to do
    OPTIMIZE EVERYTHING UNTILL THERE IS NOTHING TO OPTIMIZE
    - Optimize the shaders
    - Multi instanced rendering
    - Need a better collision system
    - antialiasing
    - Reduce number of textures as much as possible
    - Intense parallelization(multithreading)
    - Caching of shader compilation if possible

Title : Escape from chaos

Story : 
-Character: A police officer(chief davis) in NYC - running away from a unarmed gang - wants to get to a police station which is miles away- 
-has to get through many obstacles - initally has no weapons - has to find weapons on the way - has to fight the gang members -
- in the middle gang members spawn - before the police station the gang leader spawns - has to fight him - gets to police station

characters needed 
-main character - cheif davis
-gang leader
-3 gang members

Background
-NYC(see reference)

Objects 
- 2 types of granades
- 4 types of guns
- 1 first aid kit
- 1 bullet box

Some misc points:
- I want the whole theme to be in a dark and night style.
- The characters must have all body parts in seperate layers in illustrator so that I can animate them
- The background must be modular so that I can make it as long as I want(using procedural generation)
- The background must have 3 layers - background, midground, foreground

If time permits
---more as progress moves on
