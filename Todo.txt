Things to be done
    -Things I can do right now
        -ANIMATION(BIG ONE HUGE PRIORITY)
            -Need to implement frame rate independent physics
            -Need to seperate renderobject from physics class
            -Need to find a way to store animations
            -Design the animation class to be as simple as possible
        

    -Later
        -death screen
        -level design
        -Enemy AI
        -particle effects
        -Need a better collision system
        -multiple weapons

    -Paused for now as other things are needed before we can further work on this
        -Level editor class and cpp file
        -Level File system
          
Optimizations I want to do
    - seperate textures from the RenderClass. TextureClass maybe?
    - Optimize the shaders
    - Multi instanced rendering

If time permits
    -Add ability in level editor to import your own textures
---more as progress moves on
